# Lone Warrior

18th July 2023

It's rainy outside, I am in Summer Vacations in Haldwani.

I just wanted some thoughts to come out which are there somehow, I really want to make sure I am there to listen to these thoughts and figure them out.

Life in general is a lone process. Yes, you do have a family and friends who cares for you, who are there for you when you are down and they are the one why you exists. Despite of people having around and loving you, you are alone in this life. This is the truth. This is the truth. You are the one who has to figure it out on your own. No one can make your job done, It's you who is the only one responsible for things you have or haven't and more than that. 

That this responsibility. And that's how life works. People can't get inside you and see what going on, they though they might pretend that they know you, but only person who really knows you is only and only you. You are the only one who is there for you in the bigger sense.

Where I wanna direct this talk is, when you are alone in your company, do something that is really good for you. You are getting better by doing those activities, it maybe doing your tasks, learning skills, writing yourself down on the paper, thinking about the life and other important things. But don't waste that time. That is the time that decides where you will end up in life. Be honest with yourself and with your body and with your mind.


I love Sadhguru Ji saying this that doesn't matter how many times and how hard people rub with each other, they wouldn't become one. This one is very precious place to be in. Sorry for my lack of words here. I don't know if this is possible or not. If being one is a thing or not. And even if it is a thing, how to get there is a another milestone. 

But the stitch I wanna tag here is you are alone and you can't expect people to be you, because that is next to impossible. 

Meaning you have to work hard on your own. You were and are a lone warrior in the battle ground. Go Arjun put your bow in your arms and fight for yourself.

Fighting for yourself also means fighting against yourself because many times you are harming yourself more than anyone else. And more often fighting yourself is the biggest milestone in this journey. 

Fight for yourself also means to improve the quality of archeries you have. Also means to make yourself stronger. Also means to be the fearless. The ultimate warrior. Forget others, already they are none of the deal in your life, You should be the greatest warrior in your own world.

In modern times you need to resolve more fights against yourself than against others.

Be the one who really cares about yourself. Be the one who is really working hard to make yourself stronger. Be the one who is busy in polishing and increasing the archeries he need. Be the one who is fearless. Be like a warrior. You will eventually become unstoppable. 

Remove all the distractions from your life, and focus only on yourself.

~Yours

Thank You Bhagwan Ji for all this. I am grateful :)
