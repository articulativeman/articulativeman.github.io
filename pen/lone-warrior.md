# Lone Warrior

July 18, 2023

It's rainy outside, and I am on Summer vacation in Haldwani.

I just wanted some thoughts to come out that are there somehow, and I want to make sure I am there to listen to them and figure them out. Say, unclogging my brain.

Life in general is a lonely process. 

Yes, you do have family and friends who care for you. Are there for you when you are down, and they are the reason you exist. Despite having people around who love you, you are alone in this life. This is the truth. You are the one who has to figure it out on your own. No one can make your job done; It’s you who is the only one responsible for your life.

People can’t get inside you and see what's going on. They might pretend that they know you, but the only person who knows you is you. You are the only one who is there for you in a more considerable sense.

Where I want to direct this talk is: when you are alone in your company, do something really good for you. You are getting better by doing those activities; it may be doing your tasks, learning skills, writing yourself down on paper, being creative, and other important things. But don’t waste that time. That time will decide where you will end up in life. Be honest with yourself, with your body, and with your mind.

I heard Sadhguru Ji's saying this long back; it doesn’t matter how many times and how hard people rub with each other, they won’t become one. I don’t know if this is possible or not, whether being one is a thing or not. And even if it is a possibility, how to get there is another milestone.

But the chit I want to tag here is that you are alone, and you can’t expect people to be you because that is simply impossible.

You have to work hard on your own. You were and are a lone warrior on the battlefield. Go, Arjun put your bow in your arms, and fight for yourself.

Fighting for yourself also means fighting against yourself, because many times you are harming yourself more than anyone else. And more often than not, fighting yourself is the biggest milestone in this journey. You need to resolve more combats against yourself than against others.

Fighting for yourself also means improving the quality of the archery you have. Also points to make yourself stronger. Also means to be fearless.

Be the one who cares about you. Be the one who is working hard to make yourself stronger. Be the one who is busy polishing and increasing the archery he needs. Be the fearless one. Be like a warrior. You will eventually become unstoppable.

Remove all the distractions from your life and focus only on yourself.

I am feeling grateful for this life.

~Yours
