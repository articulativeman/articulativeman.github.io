# Lone Warrior

July 18, 2023

It’s rainy outside, and I am on Summer vacation in Haldwani.

I just wanted some thoughts to come out that are there somehow, and I really want to make sure I am there to listen to them and figure them out.

Life in general is a lonely process. Yes, you do have family and friends who care for you and are there for you when you are down, and they are the reason you exist. Despite having people around who love you, you are alone in this life. This is the truth. This is the truth. You are the one who has to figure it out on your own. No one can make your job done; It’s you who are the only one responsible for things you have or haven't, and more than that.

That this responsibility And that’s how life works. People can’t get inside you and see what's going on; they might pretend that they know you, but the only person who really knows you is you. You are the only one who is there for you in the larger sense.

Where I want to direct this talk is: when you are alone in your company, do something that is really good for you. You are getting better by doing those activities; it may be doing your tasks, learning skills, writing yourself down on paper, thinking about life, and other important things. But don’t waste that time. That is the time that decides where you will end up in life. Be honest with yourself, with your body, and with your mind.

I love Sadhguru Ji's saying that it doesn’t matter how many times and how hard people rub with each other, they won’t become one. This is a very precious place to be. Sorry for my lack of words here. I don’t know if this is possible or not. whether being one is a thing or not. And even if it is a thing, how to get there is another milestone.

But the stitch I want to tag here is that you are alone, and you can’t expect people to be you because that is next to impossible.

Meaning you have to work hard on your own. You were and are a lone warrior on the battlefield. Go, Arjun, put your bow in your arms, and fight for yourself.

Fighting for yourself also means fighting against yourself, because many times you are harming yourself more than anyone else. And more often than not, fighting yourself is the biggest milestone in this journey.

Fighting for yourself also means improving the quality of the archery you have. Also means to make yourself stronger. Also means to be fearless. The ultimate warrior Forget others; they are already out of the picture in your life. You should be the greatest warrior in your own world.

In modern times, you need to resolve more fights against yourself than against others.

Be the one who really cares about yourself. Be the one who is really working hard to make yourself stronger. Be the one who is busy polishing and increasing the archery he needs. Be the one who is fearless. Be like a warrior. You will eventually become unstoppable.

Remove all the distractions from your life and focus only on yourself.

Thank you, Bhagwan Ji, for all this. I am grateful.

~Yours
